\section{Introduction}
\textit{Cyber-physical systems} (CPSs) are integration of computation with physical processes whose behavior is defined by both computational and physical parts of the system \cite{Zanero17}. Embedded computers and networks monitor and control the physical processes, usually with feedback loops where physical processes affect computations and vice versa. The heterogeneity is one of the main characteristics of CPSs. The components of CPSs are of various types, requiring interfacing and interoperability across multiple platforms and different models of computation. Verifying  heterogeneous CPSs requires the use of heterogeneous simulation environments. One emerging industry standard is the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) \cite{Blochwitz2011The}\cite{BromanBGLMTW13}. It is a standard to support simulation of complex systems composed of heterogeneous components, by coupling the different models with their own solver in a co-simulation environment.

The FMI standard was first developed in the MODELISAR project started in 2008 and supported by a large number of software companies and research centers \cite{ClauMODELISAR}. FMI offers the means for model based development of systems and is particularly appropriate way to develop complex CPSs.  However, there  are
