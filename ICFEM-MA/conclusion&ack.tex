\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion&ack}
This paper has presented our novel approach to check the FMI co-simulation , which facilitates the formal analysis of CPSs. This involves model checking the reachability, livelock and deadlock of three various master algorithms. Besides, the correctness and  relevant system properties of the architecture are also analysed. To achieve the goal, we encode the FMU and master algorithms with timed automata. Then the properties of the co-simulation are verified with UPPAAL. We evaluate this approach using the example water tank. The results show that our approach is feasible and useful.

An interesting direction of future work is that we attempt to analyse and compare the performance of various master algorithms in the future. Besides, more complex case studies will be conducted to check the scalability of proposed approach. The tool support for our approach should be improved further.
