\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The core idea of Statistical Model Checking (SMC) is to decide whether the stochastic model satisfies a given property or to evaluate its probability of satisfaction by combining statistical techniques with Monte-Carlo simulation on model traces. However, SMC still encounters performance bottleneck due to the consumption of the extremely large number of traces, each of which itself could be extremely time-consuming. To solve these problems, we have proposed an optimized SMC approach called AL-SMC to reduce the number of traces in our previous work. In order to reduce the time consumption for generating a single trace further, we propose a general framework for distributed SMC based on master/slaves architecture without introducing bias. A series of algorithms are introduced to show that bayesian interval estimation (BIE) algorithm and AL-SMC are easily parallelizable on our general framework. Besides, we propose parameter optimization approach with a genetic algorithm to reduce the statistical error of distributed AL-SMC (DAL-SMC). We also implemented DAL-SMC algorithms in our ModanaOnline platform to support the automatic process. To illustrate the feasibility of our approach, three benchmarks are presented to compare the number of simulation traces, time consumption and statistical error between DAL-SMC and classic SMC algorithms. The experiment results show that the time consumption of our toolset is effectively reduced and the accuracy is ensured within an acceptable error bound.
