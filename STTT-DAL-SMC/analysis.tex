\section{Algorithm Analysis of DAL-SMC}

\subsection{Time and space complexity}
We analyse the time and space complexity of DAL-SMC as shown in Table~\ref{tb:complexity}.

(i)The time and space complexity of abstraction process are $O(mn)+O(min(k^3,n^3))$ and $O(k^2)$ respectively, where $m$ denotes the length of the trace, $n$ denotes the number of sampling traces and $k$ denotes the dimension of each trace.

(ii)The time and space complexity of PFT construction are respectively $O(mn)$ + $O(d\log{d}))$ and $O(\log{d})$, where $d$ denotes the number of leaf nodes in PFT.

(iii)Suppose the iterations of BIE algorithm is B, the time complexity of each statistical test iteration is $O(i)$, and the time of searching leaf node is $\log{d}$. Therefore, the time complexity of probability evaluation is $O(B*(\log{d}+i))$.

\subsection{Error bound}
Models in step i and ii of Algorithm \ref{alg:dalm} are probabilistically equivalent in terms of a certain property. Therefore, the statistical error is only generated in probability evaluation. We use multiple BIEs to evaluate the probablity in DAL-SMC, therefore the error is enlarged compared with distributed BIE. Suppose the half-interval size of each BIE is $\delta$ and the number of BIEs is $M$, thus the error of multi-BIE is less than $\delta*M$. Besides, we use $\delta$ prediction method in section 2.4 to reduce the statistical error. Consequently, the error ($\xi$) of DAL-SMC with parameter optimization satisfies the formula \ref{formula3}.

\begin{equation}
\label{formula3}
| \xi | \leq \sum\limits_{m=1}^M (T_m / \sum\limits_{i=1}^k N_i / \eta)
\end{equation}
