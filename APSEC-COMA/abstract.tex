Cyber-physical Systems(CPSs) focus on the coupling of cyber part viewed as distributed computation units and physical part covering the environment affecting the running of the system. CPSs are often treated modularly to tackle both complexity and heterogeneity. The verification of CPSs may be done modularly by Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) co-simulation. However, the master algorithm for co-simulation may be livelock or deadlock. The architectural modelling of CPSs may introduce an algebraic loop which is a feedback loop resulting in instantaneous cyclic dependencies. To solve these problems, we propose a novel approach for model checking several properties of FMI co-simulation such as deadlock, liveness, reachability. 
We model the architecture of CPSs with SysML block diagrams, which captures the dependence of Functional Mock-up units (FMUs) and the orchestration of the master algorithm. Next, we encode FMU components and three various master algorithms with timed automata separately. Finally, we verify the correctness of the co-simulation and the absence of algebraic loops in the architecture with UPPAAL. To illustrate the feasibility of our approach, the case study water tank is presented. The results show that our approach helps model checking FMI co-simulation.
