The growing complexity of Cyber-physical Systems(CPSs)increasingly challenges existing methods and techniques. CPSs are often treated modularly to tackle both complexity and heterogeneity. A promising approach for verifying CPSs is to use Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) co-simulation techniques. However, the master algorithm for co-simulation may be livelock or deadlock. The architectural modelling of CPSs may also introduce an algebraic loop which is a feedback loop resulting in instantaneous cyclic dependencies. To solve these problems, we propose a novel approach for model checking several properties of FMI co-simulation such as deadlock, liveness, reachability. 
We model the architecture of CPSs with SysML block diagrams, which captures the dependence of Functional Mock-up units (FMUs) and the orchestration of the master algorithm. To analyse the correctness of the system, we encode FMUs components and three various master algorithms with timed automata separately. With the help of encoding, we verify the master algorithms for co-simulation and the absence of algebraic loops in the architecture with UPPAAL. To illustrate the feasibility of our approach, the case study water tank is presented. The experiments show that our approach facilitates model checking FMI co-simulation.
