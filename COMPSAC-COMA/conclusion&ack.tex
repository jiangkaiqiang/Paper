\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion&ack}
In this paper, we present a novel approach to model check the coordination of CPS.  We model the architecture of CPS with SysML BDD and CD, which capture the blocks of the system and the connection of blocks. According to BDD and CD, each block is implemented as an FMU, and the coordination between blocks are implemented with MA and connector configuration. We proposed encoding rules to encode FMUs as TA. Besides, we model three various MAs with TA, which orchestrate the coordination between FMUs. With the help of the model checker UPPAAL, we  analyse the correctness of MAs and detect whether there is an algebraic loop in the architecture. By this way, the coordination of CPS is verified with model checking. To illustrate the feasibility of our approach, the case study water tank is presented. The experiment results show that the coordination behavior of CPS can be analysed effectively with our approach. 

An interesting direction of future work is to analyse and compare the performance of various MAs. We will also study how to eliminate algebraic loop of the architecture. Besides, some industrial case studies will be conducted to check the scalability of our approach. The tool implement of co-simulation should also be improved further.
