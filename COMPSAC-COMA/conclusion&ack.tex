\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion&ack}
In this paper, we present a novel approach to model check the coordination of CPS.  We model the architecture of CPS with SysML BDD and IBD, which capture the architecture of the system and the connection of blocks. According to BDD and IBD, each block is implemented as an FMU. The coordination between blocks are implemented with MA and connector configuration. To verify coordination, we proposed encoding rules to encode FMUs as TA. Besides, we model three various MAs with TA, which orchestrate the coordination between FMUs. With the help of the model checker UPPAAL, we  analyse the correctness of MAs and detect whether there is an algebraic loop in the architecture. By this way, the coordination of CPS is verified. To illustrate the feasibility of our approach, the case study water tank is presented. The experiment results show that our approach is feasible and effective. 

An interesting direction of future work is to analyse and compare the performance of various MAs. How to eliminate algebraic loop of the architecture is also an interesting problem. Besides, some industrial case studies will be conducted to check the scalability of our approach.
