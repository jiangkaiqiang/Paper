\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion&ack}
In this paper, we present a novel approach to model check the FMI-based coordination, which facilitates the formal verification of CPSs. It involves to model check the reachability, liveness and deadlock of three various MAs. Besides, the correctness of the system architecture is also analysed. To achieve the goal, we encode the FMU components and MAs with TA, so that properties of the coordination can be verified with UPPAAL. To illustrate the feasibility of our approach, the example water tank is discussed. Its architecture is specified with SysML BDDs, from which the relevant FMU components are derived to co-simulate the system behavior. With the help of encoding, the network of TA for the water tank system is built. The experiment results show that the coordination behavior of CPSs can be analysed effectively with model checking technology.

An interesting direction of future work is to analyse and compare the performance of various MAs. We will also study how to eliminate algebraic loop of the architecture. Besides, some industrial case studies will be conducted to check the scalability of our approach. The tool implement of co-simulation should also be improved further.
