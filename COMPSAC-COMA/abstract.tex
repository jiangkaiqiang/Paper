The growing complexity of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) increasingly challenges existing methods and techniques. The correctness of coordination between heterogeneous components of CPSs is very important, which attracts more and more attentions. A promising approach for verifying coordination behaviour is to apply Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI)-based co-simulation techniques to generate simulations of heterogeneous components in CPSs. 
However, the master algorithm for co-simulation may be livelock or deadlock. Moreover, the architecture modeling of CPSs may also introduce an algebraic loop which is a feedback loop resulting in cyclic dependencies. To solve these problems, we propose a novel approach for model checking several properties of coordination such as deadlock, liveness and reachability. To reach our goal, we model the architecture of CPSs with SysML block definition diagrams(BDD), which captures the dependence of Functional Mock-up Units (FMUs) and the orchestration of the master algorithm. According to BDDs models, the coordination between components are implemented with the master algorithm. We encode FMUs components with Timed Automata(TA) to bridge the semantics gap between FMUs and TA. Besides, we model three various master algorithms with timed automata, which orchestrates the coordination between FMUs. With the help of the model checker UPPAAL, we can analyse the correctness of the master algorithms and detect whether there is an algebraic loop in the architecture. 
To illustrate the feasibility of our approach, the case study water tank is presented. The experiment results show that our approach facilitates model checking coordination of CPSs. The novelty of our work is that our approach supports to analyse coordination of CPSs with timed automata.
