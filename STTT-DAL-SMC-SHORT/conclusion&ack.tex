\section{Conclusions and future work}
In this paper, we focus on improving the performance of SMC with distributed technology. When we analyse the complex CPSs with SMC, huge-sized models and high confidence of probability estimation require a great number of traces. It is extremely time-consuming. To solve this problem, we present a distributed framework for SMC without introducing bias, and propose distributed BIE and DAL-SMC algorithms based on the framework. The framework is implemented in ModanaO
nline platform which is an online platform for modelling and analysis of CPSs. Besides, the parameter optimization methods are proposed to reduce error and improve efficiency of DAL-SMC. Finally, to illustrate the feasibility of our approach, two benchmarks are presented. The experiment results show that the DAL-SMC is more efficient than other SMC algorithms. Besides, The parameter optimization method reduces statistical error effectively. 

As part of future work, in addition to focusing on the effciency of our implementation, we plan to apply our framework to more complex systems. Furthermore, we will improve our tool to make it more extendable.
