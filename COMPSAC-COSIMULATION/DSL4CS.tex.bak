\section{DSL4CS Co-simulation Language}
The design of complex systems often relies on several Domain Specific Modeling Languages (DSMLs) that may pertain to different theoretical domains with different expected expressiveness and properties. As a result, several models conforming to different DSMLs are developed and the specification of the
overall system becomes heterogeneous.

Meta-models, as defined here, provide: A language representation with strict notation and grammar. This is used to represent and store the meta-model and to share meta-model information between different tools and people. 
Model abstraction, where each external model is represented individually in a uniform and simulation tool independent way. A generic and uniform way to connect various simulation tools. Platform independent models. No operating system, network, or other co-simulation platform dependent parameters are stored in the meta-model. A single meta-model simulator application can start the simulation tools and control the co-simulation based on the meta-model.

\subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms}\label{AA}
Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, 
even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as 
IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, ac, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use 
abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.

\subsection{Using xText to Generate Concrete Syntax }
\begin{itemize}
\item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as ``3.5-inch disk drive''.
\item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
\item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: ``Wb/m\textsuperscript{2}'' or ``webers per square meter'', not ``webers/m\textsuperscript{2}''. Spell out units when they appear in text: ``. . . a few henries'', not ``. . . a few H''.
\item Use a zero before decimal points: ``0.25'', not ``.25''. Use ``cm\textsuperscript{3}'', not ``cc''.)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{CCSL semantics}
Number equations consecutively. To make your 
equations more compact, you may use the solidus (~/~), the exp function, or 
appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, 
but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus 
sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a 
sentence, as in:
\begin{equation}
a+b=\gamma\label{eq}
\end{equation}
